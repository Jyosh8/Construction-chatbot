🏗️ Construction Chatbot

📌 Overview
This is an AI-powered Construction Chatbot built using Natural Language Processing (NLP), TensorFlow, and JSON-based intent recognition. It helps users with construction-related queries, such as building new homes, renovation services, project management, and fee estimates.
The chatbot understands user inputs, processes them with machine learning, and provides responses based on predefined intents stored in a .json file. The front end is built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, while the backend runs on Python and TensorFlow.

🚀 How It Works
1️ User Interaction (Frontend)
•	Users type queries or select options from predefined buttons.
•	The chatbot interface is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring an engaging user experience.
2️ Intent Matching (Backend Processing with Python & TensorFlow)
•	User input is processed with Natural Language Processing (NLP).
•	TensorFlow helps match user queries with intents defined in a JSON file.
3️ Response Generation (JSON-Based Answers)
•	If an intent is recognized, the chatbot returns a predefined answer from the intents.json file.
•	If the query is not found, the chatbot provides a fallback response (e.g., "I’m sorry, but I can't assist with that. Please contact support.").
4️ Continuous Learning & Improvements
•	The chatbot can be improved using machine learning techniques and expanded with additional intents.

📂 Project Structure
•	intents.json → Stores predefined questions and answers for the chatbot.
•	.py → Handles NLP processing, intent matching, and response generation.
•	index.html → Frontend user interface for chatbot interaction.
•	script.js → Manages UI behavior and sends queries to the backend.
